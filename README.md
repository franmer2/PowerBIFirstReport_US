I used often to demoing Power BI Desktop and deliver presentation like "How to create your first report". Most of the time, this exercise has to be done under time constraint (between 30 and 35 minutes).
So, I created a demo long time ago (in 2013 ðŸ˜…) and improve it based on customer feedback and new features shipped in the product.

Below, a link to the video to the last version of this video. If you watch this video, you will see that I'm focussing more on the prepare and shape your data phases than using visuals to create the report itself. 
I think if you have a good semantic model, report creation should be quite easy.... And copilot can help to accelerate report creation too 
ðŸ˜‰.
